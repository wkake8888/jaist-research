===========

1. a novel framework called SgSum which transforms MDS task into the problem of sub-graph selection. 
The framework leverages graph to capture relations between sentences, and generates more informative and
coherent summaries by modeling sub-graphstructures.


2. this framework unifies single and multidocument summarization and has strong transfer ability from SDS to MDS task without any
parallel MDS training data. Thus, it can reduce the resource bottleneck in MDS tasks.
