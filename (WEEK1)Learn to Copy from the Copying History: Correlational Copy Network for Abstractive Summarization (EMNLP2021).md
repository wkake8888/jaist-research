Existing works do not attempt to calculate the copying distributions based on the copying history.

This work demonstrates that the copying history can provide crucial clues of the copying behaviors for the following time steps and thereby encourage the summarizer to copy more
accurately. intuitively,  a source word that is relevant to the previously copied one is more likely to be copied at the current time step.
